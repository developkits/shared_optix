shared_optix
============

This folder contains binaries and headers for version 3.9.0 
of the OptiX library for GPU-accelerated raytracing. We recommend 
using CUDA Toolkit 7.5 with this library, although older CUDA versions 
may also work.

This repository is used by the gl_optix_composite sample.
